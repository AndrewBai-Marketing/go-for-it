the "up 14 means they need two scores" argument is correct about the outcome but wrong about the decision. here's why.

**the situation:** pats up 9-3, score td to make it 15-3. kick pat (up 13) or go for 2 (up 14 or 12)?

**the math:**

2pt conversion rate: ~48% (league avg 2015-2024, n=1274)
pat make rate: ~94%

win probs at 10 min left:
- up 12: 94.6%
- up 13: 95.7%
- up 14: 96.7%

**expected win prob:**

kick pat: 0.94 × 95.7% + 0.06 × 94.6% = **95.66%**

go for 2: 0.48 × 96.7% + 0.52 × 94.6% = **95.56%**

pat wins by 0.1 percentage points.

**why the intuition fails:**

going for 2 is basically a coin flip lottery:
- 48% chance you're up 14
- 52% chance you're up 12

kicking pat is a near-certainty:
- 94% chance you're up 13
- 6% chance you're up 12

when you're already winning by a lot, variance hurts you. the high-probability path to +13 beats the coin flip between +14 and +12.

yes +14 is better than +13. but you only get there 48% of the time, and the other 52% you're at +12 instead of +13.

**when should you go for 2?**

when you're trailing by 7+ before the td. then you need variance to catch up and 2pt makes sense.

when you're ahead? protect the lead. kick the pat.

tl;dr: "up 14" sounds nice but you fail 52% of the time. pat was correct.
